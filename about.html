I‘m Jamie Spann: front-end web developer, mother, reader. I‘m 24 years old and currently located in south Alabama. In 2016,
I graduated from Troy University with a Bachelor of Science degree in Anthropology. I began developing websites at around
13 years old, when I would make small websites for my various interests. Throughout the years I have refined my coding skills,
 and eventually decided to make web development my career.

<P>
I have a working knowledge of HTML, CSS, Sass, Javascript and jQuery. Always trying to keep up with the rapid pace of tech,
I utilize development tools such as Twitter Bootstrap, and have some PHP knowledge. Currently, I am brushing up on my Javascript
programming skills, and eventually hope to learn React.js and more about RESTful services and eCommerce development.
</P>
<P>
One of my favorite parts of developing a website is design. From wireframing layouts to selecting appropriate and attractive
color schemes, I aim to make every website user-friendly and visually appealing. Especially in responsive design, every element
 of the web page must be considered, so that the website is cohesive and works properly on all devices.
</P>
<P>
I love not only the design and development aspects of creating a website, but also the marketing side. This proves to be an
advantage in building small to medium sized websites; because I am a part of the process from start to finish, the website
and marketing campaigns are sure to reflect the vision of the owner and will clearly communicate the ethos of the brand to
visitors.
</P>
<P>
If you are interested in working together or would like more information, please do not hesitate to contact me.
</P>
<P>
Thank you so much for visiting. I look forward to working together in the future.
