      Let's Build Your Ideal Website
    </h1>
      <span class="aboutme"><img class="abtimg" src="img/brackets.png"></span>
<P>It's 2017, and 50% of small business owners don't have a website! Whether you need a simple informational website or a larger project,
  I will be happy to work together. I offer a variety of services to cover most website needs, including design, development,
  testing, and launch; and I can also provide recommendations for affordable and reliable web hosting services. All of the websites
  I create are responsive and mobile-friendly, which means that they look great on all devices, from smartphones and tablets to
  desktops and laptops.</P>
<P>
  <B>If you're interested in working together, simply send me an email at hello@jamiesp.me.</B> I can then provide more information
  on pricing, availability, and any other questions you may have. We can schedule a meeting in-person, over the phone, or by email
  correspondence (whichever your preference) to discuss the goals you have for your new website. What is it's purpose? Will you
  need to update content frequently, integrate an eCommerce platform, or will it mostly stand on it's own? All options will require very different systems for
  maintaining and managing content. There are many things to consider in the creation of a website, and together we will create the
  perfect one for you and your needs.
</P>
<P>If you are unsure if you really need a website, or think that it will be unaffordable, please do not hesitate to contact me. I
  will be happy to discuss different prospects that may work for you, including pointing you in the direction of what
  may be a better solution. I can also work within your budget. If you don't have a large budget to drop on a website, I can customize
  the workflow to come up with a more cost-effective solution that works for both of us. Websites can be a great value to especially
  small business owners, and can serve as a sort of virtual window to your business. In this way, you should be sure that it accurately
  represents your values, and is visually appealing so as to best inform users and entice new customers.
</P>
<P>Feel free to email me anything about your project and with any questions you have. Listed below are a few questions that may help
  you compile a more informative email, so we can get started more quickly. You can answer as many or as few as you want.
</p>
<div class="content">
<ul>
  <li>A short summary of your website project.</li>
  <li>What is the purpose of the website? (i.e. informational, eCommerce, marketing a service or product, etc.)</li>
  <li>Who are your customers?</li>
  <li>What will be the name of your website?</li>
  <li>Do you have an idea of the website design and layout?</li>
  <li>What is your estimated budget?</li>
  <li>What is your timeline, e.g. how soon do you need the website completed?</li>
  <li>Do you already have a website? If so, what do you like/dislike about it? What do you want to improve upon?</li>
  <li>When can we begin working together on your website?</li>
