<P>
      A static website for a fictional coffee shop with a focus on easily accessible information and mobile experience. On the home page, the most important information for visitors is clearly listed. The address is the first on the list, so anyone can easily find the shop by clicking on the address which will take them to the Google maps page. Business hours are important to have listed, and they are also on the home page. The phone number is available as well, so that visitors with questions can call the right number, and mobile users can click right on the phone number to start the call.
</P><P>
      A link to the company’s Facebook page is clearly visible so the visitor knows where to find daily specials, photos, and more. I think this is relevant because many businesses these days use Facebook in lieu of a website because it is much easier to upload content daily. However, I think a simple website with easily accessible business info can still be a great asset to businesses of any kind.
</P><P>
      Underneath the primary information area is a full-width Google map with the coffee shop place marked. The map has been customized to match the website’s color palette, so it not only looks great but adds another method for the visitor to find the location.
</P><P>
      In the top navigation bar are links to more information if the visitor is interested. There is an about section and a contact section that can hold more detailed information such as the company history and more ways to get in contact, such as e-mail address and more.
</P><P>
      The coffee shop’s entire menu is also available on the website. Designed with user experience in mind, this menu is extremely easy to navigate and read. With a drop-down style, visitors can select which menu they would like to see and they are given menu items along with descriptions and pricing (one of the most popular restaurant search requests!).
</P><P>
      With this method there is no need for daily and monthly website maintenance. And because it is a static website, there are no security concerns. This reduces both time and money spent maintaining the website, so that the owner can focus on their business. Let the website handle most general inquiries and entice customers on the go to stop by and visit.
